Project Overview

This project is my inaugural venture into the world of machine learning, with a focus on understanding the entire lifecycle of a machine learning project. From data preprocessing to model deployment, this project aims to provide a hands-on experience with each critical phase of developing a predictive model, while also emphasizing effective team collaboration.
Project Goal

The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that determines whether a flight will arrive at its destination with a delay of at least 15 minutes. The model utilizes various flight-related features, including:

    Carrier Name
    Distance to Destination
    Flight Date
    Additional relevant attributes

Key Aspects

    Data Preprocessing: Involves cleaning and organizing the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
    Feature Engineering: Focuses on selecting and creating features that enhance the model's performance.
    Model Development: Includes training, tuning, and evaluating different machine learning algorithms.
    Deployment: Prepares the final model for real-world application and implements deployment strategies.
    Team Collaboration: Highlights the importance of working cohesively with team members, supporting each other through the project lifecycle.

This project is designed not only to build a functional predictive model but also to provide valuable insights into the end-to-end process of machine learning, from conception to deployment.
